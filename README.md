Thank you for viewing this repo!
This is a fully functioning Tic Tac Toe game that communicates with a pre-built API.
This is built mainly with HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery.
To begin this project, I designed the wireframe seen below. As you can see, though, my vision for the layout of this gam has not been fully realized. Nevertheless, the functionality has been.
The first day or so I spent writing only pseudo code, breaking down the problem and recording/ responding to any new problems that arose. I then moved onto designing the board and game logic. This process required inserting all elements seen on the page excluding the modal.
The modal was built after to house all of the forms used by the user to interact with the API (sign in, change password, etc.).
After those were completed, I began working on the game API. Getting PATCH to work proved to be the most difficult part of building this game. I could not seem to get the API to accept the data being put into my request. This was resolved by using JSON.stringify().
Going forward, I would like to design the game to appear closer to my wireframe and also I would like to improve some features in the options modal. Namely, I would like passwords to be hidden when entered and I would like the forms to clear once submitted.
